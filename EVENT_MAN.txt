How to add/modify events:

(1) Open spreadsheets/events_calendar.xsls
(2) Go to the appropriate term sheet (i.e, C22, D22, etc.). If it does not exist, create one
(3) Fill out each of the five fields:
(a) Title: for normal events, put "Casuals", otherwise an appropriate title 
(b) Start: the start time of the event, in EST and 24 hour time, following the format used in prior events 
(c) End: end time of the event (for casuals, midnight is fine). Again, follow the same format as for Start time 
(d) Description: a short description. Feel free to use the same for each casuals for the most part. Also feel free to update it.
(e) Image: the image for the event that appears on the homepage of the website. A cool poster or promotional material would go well here.
(4) Save the spreadsheet. Publish the changes:
(a) Go to a termianl in the parent directory of the folder.
(b) Type `git add .`
(c) Type `git commit -m "added or modified events"
(d) Type `git push`
NOTE: if you have not used git before and need help installing/setting it up, ask a more CS-y officer or friend. Otherwise contact the owner of the repository for aid.

After a few minutes, the changes should be reflected.
