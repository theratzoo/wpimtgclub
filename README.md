### WPI MTG Club official website!

This is the repository containing all the code to the website. Below is a list of code that is included in the repository:

* Scripts, which are used for getting data such as TCGPlayer Product Ids/SKUs, lowest price of cards, and Scryfall data for querying purposes.

* Spreadsheets to store the data and make it so the scripts don't have to be run all the time.

* NextJS pages, which display the website.

The website can be viewed on the below link (temporary, will move to a dedicated domain in the future):
* https://wpimtgclub.vercel.app/

If you have any suggestions for the project, please shoot an email to wpimtgclub@gmail.com
