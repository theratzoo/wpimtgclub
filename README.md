### WPI MTG Club official website!

This is the repository containing all the code to the website. 

Currently, there is nothing here! Except this README, and the below To-Do list:

- figure out what our domain name will be (wpimtg.com? wpimtgclub.com? something else?)
- decide what service to use for hosting purposes (Vercel seems like a good free solution, or anything else w/ serverless functions)
- create simple models/storyboards
- (optional) create dummy code to understand how to use TCGplayer' API

Below are all the features we plan to implement in the website:

- a home page that has a brief about us and other stuff like discord link, club execs, etc.
- have a page for the cards that the club is selling, with live pricing, card hovering (deckbox.org has a solution for this), and a method to reserve cards so you can buy them from the club. oh and a search and filter feature of course!
- an online events calendar that will show casuals, upcoming drafts, and other events like Gaming Weekend
- definitely somewhere to fill out a form for any ideas/suggestions/bugs/whatever
- any other ideas that we come up with along the way
